# FoodFacts

FoodFacts is a Kotlin project that leverages TensorFlow to automatically detect food items and provide their corresponding nutrition information. This project aims to simplify the process of retrieving nutritional data for various food items by utilizing image recognition techniques.

## Features

- Automatic food item detection: FoodFacts uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to analyze images and identify different food items present in the picture.
- Nutrition information retrieval: Once the food items are detected, the application fetches their nutrition data from a reliable database or API.
- User-friendly interface: FoodFacts provides a simple and intuitive user interface to upload images, display the detected food items, and showcase their nutrition information.
